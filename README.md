This mod combines the work by Katniss et al for KatnissCapeCanaveral and the height and color map from AnticlockwisePropeller's RSSHiDefCape, while also fixing certain issues in both. Full credit to Katniss et al and to AnticlockwisePropeller.

Installation: Merge the included GameData folder with your KSP install's GameData.
Requires RSS, obviously.
