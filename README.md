# KatnisssCapeCanaveral

Some people wanted this, so there you go. :D

Requires Kerbal Konstructs for the LC39.

Not tested with RP-1 (LC39 should allow 99x99x999, 99999t rockets, and is free to open - balancing it is not on my priprity list, as I don't play RP-1 and don't even know how it's supposed to be balanced)
