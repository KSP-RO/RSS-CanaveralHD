Some people wanted this, so there you go. :D

*Turning KSP into Orbiter since 2020*

Requires Kerbal Konstructs for the LC39.

Not tested with RP-1 (LC39 should allow 99x99x999m, 99999t rockets, and is free to open - balancing it is not on my priprity list, as I don't play RP-1 and don't even know how it's supposed to be balanced)

To download, clone the repo (or download as .zip, doesn't really matter) and copy-paste the gameData directory (or contents, again, doesn't matter)

RSS-TEXTURES should be installed before otherwise it will replace the modified heightmap and result in visual artifacts.
