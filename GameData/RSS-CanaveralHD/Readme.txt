High Definition Terrain for Cape Canaveral (Kennedy Space Center, CCAFS, and surroundings).

This mod combines the work by Katniss et al for KatnissCapeCanaveral and the height and color map from AnticlockwisePropeller's RSSHiDefCape, while also fixing certain issues in both. Full credit to Katniss et al and to AnticlockwisePropeller.

Installation: Merge the included GameData folder with your KSP install's GameData. Requires RSS, obviously. 

NOTE: there is some terrain "under" the hi-detail static mesh of the Cape, but not everywhere. Land only on the KSC runway or the Shuttle Landing Facility. And besides, in real life it's a marshy mess, you couldn't land planes off-runway anyway.

Also, be careful about not placing your craft under the floor in the VAB, otherwise you may be treated as "splashed" on vessel load.
